üìò Vega Cockpit ‚Äî README
Overview

Vega Cockpit is your trading dashboard and AI co-pilot, designed to:

Track trades, logs, and journals

Run daily/weekly Scorecards

Monitor system resources (‚Äúshields before swords‚Äù)

Enforce Smart Money trading rules and defensive guardrails

‚ö° Quickstart (Day-1 MVP)

Drop your service account key into the project root as:

credentials.json


Run locally

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py


Deploy on Render

Create a new Web Service using this repo and render.yaml

After service is created, add a Secret File named credentials.json and paste the full JSON

Open the URL: verify the Watchlist and Quick Log work with your Google Sheet

üìä Google Sheets Integration

Expects a Google Sheet tab named COCKPIT

Watchlist reads: A2:D50 ‚Üí columns: Ticker | Strategy | Entry | Stop

Quick log appends: [timestamp, type, symbol, status, notes] into the COCKPIT tab
