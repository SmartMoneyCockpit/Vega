- Trade Entry Filter: No trades unless conditions match Smart Money + macro filter

6. AUTOMATION, REFRESH, EXPORTS

  - Google Sheets backup for each day's logs
- Macro calendars: Live Daily + Weekly planner
- Macro + Health + Trade alerts sent via webhook (Telegram excluded)

DEPLOYMENT ACTIONS:
1. Build and deliver final cockpit ZIP (fully bundled with all modules, assets, and fallback logic)
2. Push to GitHub (main + staging branches synced)
3. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud from GitHub
   - Set necessary environment variables (e.g. GOOGLE_API_KEY) if required
   - Test Streamlit launch and confirm live app
4. Initialize Live Agent Runtime
   - Folder and file check passes
   - Live Agent starts without error
   - Logs stored in logs/deployment_complete.log
5. Run webhook test (optional but recommended)

AGENT EXIT CRITERIA:
âœ… No crash or runtime errors  
âœ… All modules load with success  
âœ… Streamlit and GitHub in sync  
âœ… ZIP is stored locally and archived  
âœ… Journal, Logger, Strategy, Health, Hedging, Alerting, Macro Systems are all live  
âœ… deployment_complete.log confirms system integrity  

ADDITIONAL USER INFO:
- GitHub repo is already created (reuse existing)  
- Google Sheet named "COCKPIT" is ready with correct structure  
- IBKR Trader Workstation + Gateway are installed and set to autorun  
- Visual assets (coin, placeholder animals) approved and available  
- Cockpit local path is assumed to be Desktop/cockpit/ unless overridden  

AFTER COMPLETION, REPORT:
"Cockpit is fully operational. No further modules or upgrades are available. System is execution-ready."

Smart Money Cockpit
===================

This project provides a **Streamlit** dashboard for personal trading and wellness management.  The dashboard includes a suite of modules for logging trades, monitoring health, drafting strategies, generating daily briefings, and tracking macroeconomic and market data.  It is designed to run either locally or on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) from a single ZIP archive, without requiring manual uploads after deployment.

## Features

- **Trade Logger** â€“ record trades, including position size, entry/exit prices, and notes.  Logged trades are synchronised to a GoogleÂ Sheet named **COCKPIT**.
- **SmartÂ MoneyÂ Logic** â€“ a placeholder for your custom trading algorithms.  The module includes a framework for analysing order flow and positioning but does not implement proprietary logic by default.
- **Health Tracker** â€“ track daily wellness metrics such as sleep, exercise, heart rate, and mood.  Integrated suggestions for vagal tone exercises are generated after workout entries.
- **DailyÂ MorningÂ Briefing** â€“ automatically generates a morning briefing summarising overnight market moves and upcoming macro events.  Data sources are configurable and can be extended.
- **Journal Logger** â€“ a unified journal where trade logs, health entries and strategy notes are automatically stored.  Entries are written to both the local data folder and the **COCKPIT** GoogleÂ Sheet.
- **Strategy Builder** â€“ define and save trading strategies.  Users can specify indicators, risk parameters, entry/exit rules and notes.
- **PDFÂ Generator** â€“ export selected reports (e.g. daily briefing or journal) to PDF using the `reportlab` library.
- **Training Tier** â€“ keep track of educational materials, backtests and practice exercises.  This module is intentionally flexible to fit individual workflows.
- **Macro/Micro Dashboard** â€“ display realâ€‘time macroeconomic data, index levels, yield curves and sentiment indicators.
- **BearÂ Mode / Tailâ€‘Risk Watchlist** â€“ monitor riskâ€‘off assets and configure price alerts.  Users can set thresholds for volatility spikes and tailâ€‘risk events.
- **ETF Dashboard** â€“ track swingâ€‘toâ€‘investing ETFs across Japan, Korea, Australia and Hong Kong.  Charts are sourced via `yfinance`.
- **BoJ Rate Hike Playbook** â€“ follow Japanese FX triggers and sector watchlists around potential Bank of Japan rate changes.
- **Tariffâ€‘Aware Canada Stock Screener** â€“ screen Canadian stocks with tariff grades, USMCA filters and smart money scores.  The grading logic is stubbed but can be expanded.
- **Preferred Income Basket Tracker** â€“ track preferred share ETFs (ZPR, HPR, CPD) with stopâ€‘yield logic.
- **LiveÂ PnL Tracker** â€“ monitor live profit and loss using data from IBKR (Interactive Brokers).  The integration uses `ib_insync`, but live data requires credentials and the IBKR gateway running.
- **SPYÂ andÂ Contra ETF Tracker** â€“ follow SPY and leveraged inverse ETFs such as SPXU, SQQQ and RWM.  Includes simple performance charts and relative strength comparisons.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a virtual environment.  The dependencies include Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, YFinance, GSpread and others.
2. **GoogleÂ Sheets credentials**:  To enable sheet synchronisation, create a GoogleÂ Service account and download the JSON credentials file.  Save it as `credentials.json` in the project root or configure the path in `modules/google_sheets.py`.  Make sure the service account has access to a GoogleÂ Sheet named `COCKPIT`.
3. **IBKR integration**:  To pull live data from InteractiveÂ Brokers, ensure the IB Gateway or TraderÂ Workstation is running, and set your IBKR host/port in the `.env` file.  The module `modules/ibkr.py` uses `ib_insync` to connect.
4. **Running locally**:  From the project root, run `streamlit run app.py`.  The application should start in your default browser.
5. **Deploying to StreamlitÂ Cloud**:  Compress the entire `smart_money_cockpit` directory into a zip archive (`smart_money_cockpit.zip`) and upload it to the StreamlitÂ Cloud interface.  Make sure to include all dependencies and assets.

## Customisation

The project is intentionally modular.  Each module lives in its own file under the `modules/` directory.  You can modify or extend these modules to fit your specific workflows.  Placeholder functions are clearly marked and can be replaced with your own logic.  For example, if you have a proprietary smart money algorithm, you can implement it in `modules/smart_money_logic.py`.

Visual branding assets (coin graphic and animal photos) are stored in the `assets/` directory.  You can replace these images with your own files while keeping the same filenames to avoid code changes.
